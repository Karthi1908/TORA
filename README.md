Decentralised Truth Oracle on Tezos

### Fake News
Wikipedia defines "Fake news" as false or misleading information presented as news.Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity or making money through advertising revenue. Fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. With the advent of social media, the prevalence of fake news has increased, especially the Facebook News Feed, and Twitter and this misinformation is gradually seeping into the mainstream media. Several factors have been implicated in the spread of fake news, such as political polarization, post-truth politics, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, and social media algorithms.
    It has been a trend recently with the increase in Fake News during election times and thereby creating the increased polarisation of masses and civil unrest. Hence Fake News is disturbing the democratic process in Liberal democracies.

### Fact Checkers:
  Fact-checkers are organisations that verify the news to promote the veracity and correctness of reporting. Leading agencies like AFP, Factcheck.org, Full facts etc have been doing commendable jobs in busting fake news. However, the key question for people is if the news publishers cannot be trusted, then how could they trust the fact-checking agencies i.e who is checking the fact-checkers? There is always some distrust of fact-checkers because of alleged liberal bias.
 
### T-ORA

  As per a recent paper published in <a href ='https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf4393'> Science Advances </a>, in judging the truthfulness of headlines, the ratings of a small, politically balanced group of laypeople closely corresponded to the ratings of professional fact-checkers. T-ORA (Truth Oracle ) is built upon the research paper where news published on social media can be verified by common people rather than a professional fact-checker. Thus the T-ORA by utilising the "Wisdom of Crowd" concept in fact-checking, it aims to provide a scalable solution for checking millions of social media posts by employing thousands of common people.
 
  T-ORA 's mission is to provide decentralised scalable fact-checking and Basic Income for the common people.
  
### How it works

T-ORA currently is integrated to pull the tweets from Twitter for any specified user id.
    1. Based on the given input, the script pulls the tweets from Twitter
    
    
    2. Pulled tweets are then uploaded automatically to the Oracle smart contract via In Memory signer.
    
    
    3. Once uploaded the checker start verifying the posts and vote whether it is Fact or Fake
    
    
    4. The Checker needs to post a stake amount in Tez before the verifying process.
    
    
    5. After the verification process, the stake of the checker who votes incorrectly will be slashed by 20%
    
    
    6. The voters who voted correctly will be rewarded from the slashed stake.
