Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. Fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. With the advent of the social media, the prevalence of fake news has increased , especially the Facebook News Feed, Twitter and this misinformation is gradually seeping into the mainstream media. Several factors have been implicated in the spread of fake news, such as political polarization, post-truth politics, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, and social media algorithms.
    It has been treand recently with increase in Fake News during election times and thereby creating the increased polarisation of masses and civil unrest. Hence Fake News is disturbing democratic process in Liberal democracies.

### Fact Checkers:
  Fact checkers are organisation that verify the news to promote the veracity and correctness of reporting. Leading agencies like AFP, Factcheck.org ,Full facts etc have been doing commendable jobs in busting fake news . However , the key question in people is if the news publishers cannot be trusted , then how could they trust the fact checking agencies i.e who is checking the fact checkers? There is alwyassome distrust on fact-checkers because of alleged liberal bias.
